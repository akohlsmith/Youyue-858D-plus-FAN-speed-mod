SAFETY WARNING:
===============

The device You are about to modify has exposed 240V parts when the AC cord is plugged in.

Touching any of these parts may cause you to die (for real). This is final.

Be EXTREMELY careful when following the installation instructions below, or let someone
else with suitable qualifications do it.

Avoid making adjustments on a live circuit. If you have to, use an isolation-transformer
(one hand only).

I shall not be held responsible for any damages that may result from following
the steps below.


Installation:
=============

* UNPLUG the AC cord.

* REMOVE R3 (10k, SMD 0805) on the main circuit board BEFORE adding this mod. This disconnects
  the FAN voltage sensing (default state) going to PC5 (pin #28).

* Add a 1 Ohm current sense resistor as shown.

* Connect the mod-board to the ATmega168/328 as shown.


From here on, the circuitry needs to be powered.
This bears the risk of lethal electrical shock. Only use insulated tools (screwdrivers...)


* Set Vref to about 70mV, measured at the center-tab of the potentiometer.

* Use an oscilloscope to verify the signal after the comparator (LM2904 pin #1).
  It should show short square pulses for all fan speeds.
  Adjust Vref for best overall performance.

* Check the signal after the RC low-pass filter (LM2904 pin #5): flat-line.

* Adjust the gain to acchieve an output voltage of about 5V (Vout) when the fan 
  spins at its highest speed. Make sure the opamp does not saturate.
  The voltage should show immediate response to fan-speed changes.

* If everything appears to work, de-energize everything & reassemble.

* You may have to adjust the fan-speed configuration parameters.
  Consult the manual.
